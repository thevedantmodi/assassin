- All players will be assigned a distinct target, and attempt to "assassinate"
the target. The game will run until a single player remains un-"assassinated".

- All players will carry a plastic spoon. A player can attack their target by
tapping them with their spoon, assassinating them.

- Once a victim is assassinated, the assassin will take on the target of the
victim. If the victim has the assassin as the target, stop playing for this
round.

- Both the victim and the assassin must update in the Slack if the victim has
been assassinated. 

- A player cannot be assassinated if they are visibly displaying a stuffed animal.

- A player cannot be assassinated if they are actively in class, actively in a
meeting, in the bathroom, or at their home.

- You must provide video evidence of the assassin.

- Plastic spoons to come -- I will leave them in a TBD location in the JCC for
you to take.
